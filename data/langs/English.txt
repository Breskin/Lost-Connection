What happened here!?
Maybe someone broke the connection?
I need to check it.
Just as I thought...
I do not know who did it, but I have to fix it.
You have to help me restore the connection
Use WASD to move.
There's a hole in this tree, may I can go through it.
I probably need to jump...
There is a lot of caves, maybe it means something.
I cannot see anything! I have to go after dark.
I've been here very long ago... So much has changed
It seems that there's nothing there...
It's interesting
OK, now I have my internet connection back, thanks for your help!
